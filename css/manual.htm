		<strong>NOTES ON SETTINGS</strong></p>
	<p>
		The game will run much faster in fullscreen mode</p>
	<p>
		Turning up the population and squad size multipliers in the options will 
		significantly slow performance.</p>
	<p>
		Anti-alias won&#39;t work but you can turn it on in your nVidia control panel 
		(especially for transparency, that will improve hair and grass a lot)</p>
	<p>
		For more performance, reduce the foliage/grass, shadows and view distance settings</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<strong>GETTING STARTED, WHAT CAN I DO?</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>You won&#39;t survive alone. Go into nearby bars (buildings with a sign that has a 
			bottle on it) and talk to the guys named &quot;sword for hire&quot;.&nbsp; You can recruit 
			these guys.</li>
		<li>Click the &quot;map&quot; button to see a world map.&nbsp; It has all the towns marked on 
			it.</li>
		<li>There are also shops in each town where you can buy weapons and armour.</li>
		<li>You need a medkit in your inventory to heal wounds.&nbsp; A good medic can often 
			rescue your whole team after they lose a battle.</li>
		<li>If you go to a trade center you can buy trade goods.&nbsp; Find a cheap product 
			and then go and sell it in another town for a profit.&nbsp; You can make a lot 
			of money this way.</li>
		<li>The desert is dangerous, its full of bandits who are stronger than you.&nbsp; 
			Take your time, be cautious, build up your strength and join in other peoples 
			battles until you are strong enough to hold your own.&nbsp; Soon you will be 
			kicking ass.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<strong>WHAT FEATURES WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE?</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cannibals, slavers, police, and enemies that can capture and imprison your men, 
			who you can rescue with your remaining guys.</li>
		<li>Lots more factions and complexity to the world, improvements to the AI</li>
		<li>Later on you will be able to use your owned buildings to open a shop, or a 
			hospital.</li>
		<li>Ability to join factions and do dynamic missions for them.&nbsp; AI factions will also 
			give missions to other factions and NPCs, not just you.</li>
		<li>Building and town siege warfare.</li>
		<li>The world map will be a lot bigger.&nbsp; Towns will be procedurally generated, 
			meaning I can fill the whole world single-handed and it will be different every 
			time you start a new game.</li>
		<li>Ranged combat.&nbsp; Crossbows and harpoon turrets.</li>
		<li>Unarmed combat</li>
		<li>Thief skills, stealing, sneaking, escaping from jail.</li>
		<li>Survival elements, you will need a supply of food and water, and need shelter to 
			survive storms.&nbsp; Endurance and fitness will factor in to combat.</li>
		<li>Limb amputation, and robotic replacements</li>
		<li>Blood sprays, splats, lots of blood</li>
		<li>More animations to represent impact, injuries, damage and exhaustion.</li>
		<li>Dialog system that will be linked into the AI.&nbsp; Characters will say things at 
			times based on their intentions, motivations, opinions and events.</li>
		<li>More races are planned, other than just humans.</li>
		<li>Wildlife, creatures, monsters, herds.</li>
	</ul>
